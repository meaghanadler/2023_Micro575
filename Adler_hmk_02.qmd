## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
2 + 2
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Homework 2 Questions:

1.  What were the main issues in the Reinhard and Rogoff issue, and how best could they have been avoided?

2.  What key attributes make a piece of data analysis "reproducible"? Please put those attributes in a prioritized list (i.e., for you, what is most important, nextÂ  most important, etc\...)

3.  Imagine that you are doing a piece of data analysis that only you will ever see: perhaps you are shopping for a car and trying to determine what will give you the best value for your money. Should you think about making your data analysis reproducible? Why or why not?
