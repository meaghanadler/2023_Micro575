# Joins

1. Imagine youâ€™ve found the top 10 most popular destinations using this code:
```{r, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
top_dest <- flights |>
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) |>
  head(10)
```
How can you find all flights to those destinations?
- Worked wtih Eva in class Friday
```{r, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#Use top_dest as primary key, adding all of secondary key columns to it
all_flights_sloppy<- top_dest|>
  left_join(flights)|>
  select(dest, flight)

#Use top_dest as primary key, add only selected column from secondary key to it
all_flights_pretty <- top_dest |>
  cross_join(as.data.frame(flights$flight))
#I don't know if this actually worked
  
```

# Functions

2. Write a function to 'rescale' a numeric vector by subtracting the mean of the vector from each element and then dividing each element by the standard deviation. 
```{r, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
vector<- c(5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)

scaled_vector <- function(vector){
 (vector-mean(vector))/(sd(vector))}

#Works with vector
scaled_vector(vector)
#Check with a new vector set
Other <- c(100,120,140,150)
scaled_vector(Other)
```
