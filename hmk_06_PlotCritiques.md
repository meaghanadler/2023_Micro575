# HMK6: Meaghan’s plot critiques

## Wiley:Plot types used:

- Multi-panel figure: Compound figure- separate figure panels with different data visualizations and datasets in an arbitrary order. 

## Good plot:

- *Figure caption:* Long-read genomes. (A) Detection of telomeric TG1–3
  repeats and telomere-associated Y′ or X element sequences at ends of
  assembled contigs. TG1–3 repeats were detected as more than 20 TG
  dinucleotides in the final 100 bp of a contig, whereas Y′ and X
  elements were detected by Liftoff. Dark, medium, and light gray
  shadings indicate the presence of TG1–3 repeats, Y′ elements, or X
  elements on a contig end, respectively, whereas white indicates the
  feature was not detected. Orange and purple highlighting mark
  chromosome arms affected by reciprocal translocations. (B) Linkage
  analysis of markers on reference Chr X and XV in the CBS2888 × CLIB219
  cross. The existence of strong cross-chromosome correlation between
  Chr X and XV markers is consistent with a translocation between these
  chromosomes in strain CBS2888. (C) Gene and ORF content in assembled
  genomes. Genes and gene copies with \>30% sequence identity to
  reference genes were classified as retained reference genes or
  diverged homologs using a threshold of 95% sequence identity to the
  reference gene.

# **Positives:**

- 2 Visualing Data: Discrete values vs Continous
- 6.3 Dot plots and heatmaps: Dot plot/bar plot start at zero
- 19.1 Color Pitfalls: Follows the 3-5 category range for coloring
  groups

## Let’s think about this plot:

- *Figure Caption* Overall eukaryote diversity in Ekaluktutiak (Cambridge Bay region) revealed with high-throughput sequencing.(A) Dendrogram of Bray--Curtis dissimilarity from the Hellinger-transformed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) table containing all protist OTUs. The samples clustered primarily as under ice (Ice1 and Ice2) and open water (Open3 and Open4). (B) Relative abundance of reads classified by higher-level taxonomy. (C) Relative abundance of reads from the samples within the OTU categories following the initial core definitions. OTUs present in all samples are shown in green, OTUs with 100% prevalence in under-ice samples are in blue, OTUs with 100% prevalence in open-water samples are in orange, and the prevalence of reads from OTUs that were not defined as core is in gray.

# **Positive:**

- 6.3 Dot plots and heatmaps: Dot plot/bar plot start at zero

  # **Challenge:**

  *They are communicating a lot of their data analysis via color
  differences.*

- 4.1 Color as a tool to distinguish: Color should be used to
  distinguish groups or items that do not have an intrinsic order.
  Because it is a phylogenetic tree I would argue that it is inherently
  ordered and that aspect can be communicated differently than the
  identified phylogenetic groups themselves.

- 19.1 Color Pitfalls: Follows the 3-5 category range for coloring groups, but also uses colors within those groups
